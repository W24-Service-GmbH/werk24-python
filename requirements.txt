# This file pins exact versions of all runtime dependencies for reproducible development and testing environments.
# These are the versions that have been tested and verified to work with werk24.
# When installing werk24 as a library, pip will use the flexible constraints from pyproject.toml.
# This file is used in CI/CD pipelines and local development to ensure consistent test environments.
# Update these versions periodically after running the full test suite to verify compatibility.
