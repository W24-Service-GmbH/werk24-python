""" W24Client Module

DESCRIPTION
    The module contains everything that is needed to
    communicate with the W24 API - allowing you
    to interpret the contents of your technical drawings.

        drawing (bytes): binary representation of a technical drawing.
            Please refer to the API - documentation to learn which mime
            types are supported.

        model (bytes): binary representation of the 3d model (typically
            step). This is currently not being used and may come back
            later again.

        asks (List[W24Ask]): List of Asks that are requested from the API.

            many pages.

            filename of the drawing. Frequently this contains information
