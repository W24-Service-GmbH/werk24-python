    1. The Measure is truely unpropotional and carries an associated
        indicator.

    2. The Measure is unporportional, but not indicated as such.

    differentiate between case 1 and case 2. Once the training

    """ Measure Label associated either to a Measure or a Leader.

    Attributes:
        blurb: String representation of the item for human consumption

        quantity: Quantity for spacings, e.g., (2x). Currently only the
            indicated measure will be detected and returned. Future
            implementation could detect the spacings and return individual
            measures for the respective spacings. When we implement this
            feature, we will add an attribute to the ASK, which allows you
            to control the behavior.

        size: Size of measure as refered to in the drawing.
            Sizes are always assocated with units! This becomes important
            to remember when you are dealing with mixed-unit drawings (e.g.,
            an adapter bolt that has an ISO thread and an UTC tapped hole).
            To avoid any loss of precision, we return the size in the unit
            that was indicated on the drawing.

        unit: Length unit of the size. This information is only available
            when you request the TitleBlock as well; as only the title block
            will allow us to determine the geographic origin of the drawing.

        size_tolerance: Tolerance details. Default: General tolerances.
            By default we are refering to the general tolerances of the drawing.
            When you are also requesting the TitleBlock, we are attaching the
            applicable General Tolerances (assuming they were understood)
            to the measure. This will consider the nominal size of the
            measure.
            If the W24MeasureLabel describes a "Theoretically Exact Measure",
            i.e, the label is surrounded by a box, like: "[15]", the size_tolerance
            refers to a W24SizeToleranceTheoreticallyExact object (and is NOT None)

        thread: Optional thread details.
            The thread details describe the complete thread description
            and follow the respective standards. In consequence, the thread
            diameter of an ISO-thread will be indicated in millimeter,
            while the thread diameter of an UTS thread will be in inch.
