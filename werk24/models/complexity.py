    Material Shape Enum

    Enum for the different shapes of the material.

    a list of conventions that are used in the industry.

    We are trying to keep this list as short as possible and
    the want to ensure clear cuts among classes.

    PLATE: A plate is a flat material that is at most 17mm thick.
    This also includes sheets (typically thinner than 6mm).

    BLOCK: A block is a material that has a rectangular shape
    and is thicker than 17mm. This also includes bars (which are
    typically longer in one dimension).

    ROD: A rod is a cylindrical material. This also includes wires
    (which are typically thin and flexible), and currently includes
    tubes (which are hollow cylinders).

    TUBE: Reserved for future use!

    Manufacturing Complexity

    This class describes the complexity of the manufacturing process of the
    part. This can be used to determine the cost of the part, the time it
    takes to manufacture it, and the required expertise.

    Attributes:
    ----------

    stock_shape (W24StockShape): The shape of the stock material that is
        required to manufacture the part. This can be a PLATE, BLOCK, ROD,
        or TUBE.

    number_of_required_axes (int): The number of axes that are required to
        manufacture the part. This can be 2, 3, 4, or 5. Together with the
        stock_shape, the material category and the customer industry, this
        can be used to determien the main manufacturing process.

    materials (List[W24Material]): List of materials that are required to
        manufacture the part. This can be a list of different materials
        that are used in the part.

    tolerance_distribution (List[W24ComplexityToleranceTally]): List of
        tolerance tallies that are required to manufacture the part. This
        can be used to determine the required precision of the part.
